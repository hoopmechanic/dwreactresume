## About the project

Welcome to my responsive React resume site. This site is a full stack React project. This project was bootstrapped with the "create-react-app" module. It features a Node.js and NPM installation using the Webpack workflow to process and transcode the HTML and Javascript files.

Leveraging ES6, Bootstrap, jQuery and a few of the other vast array of Javascript libraries, the site consist of 13 React components. It is
fully responsive changing from a two column to a stacked design as the size of the viewport is adjusted. Several of the sections are generated dynamically with JSON data stored both locally and remotely. The Employment History section is rendered from data stored remotely in Firebase, a Backend-as-a-Service database provided by Google and the Software Experience section is rendered from local data with custom Javascript code to create the level indicators and the text rating from a single level value. This code can be found in the SoftItem.js.

The site is hosted on a Amazon Web Services S3 bucket. The files for the complete project are posted on my GitHub repository. Click the GitHub link in the main menu to navigate to my repository.
